# AbletonMCP

**138 tools connecting Claude AI to Ableton Live**

AbletonMCP gives Claude direct control over your Ableton Live session through the Model Context Protocol. Create tracks, write MIDI, design sounds, mix, automate, browse instruments, snapshot presets, and navigate deep into device chains and modulation matrices — all through natural language conversation.

## What It Can Do

### Music Creation

> "Create a MIDI track, load Operator, and write an 8-bar bass line in E minor"

> "Make a 4-bar jazz chord progression — Cm7, Fm7, Dm7b5, G7 — with voice leading"

> "Build a Metro Boomin style 808 beat using grid notation"

> "Set the tempo to 128 BPM, create 4 tracks, and set up a minimal techno arrangement"

> "Duplicate the 4-bar section at bar 9 to fill out the chorus"

### Sound Design

> "Load Wavetable on track 1 and design a warm detuned supersaw pad"

> "Discover all hidden parameters on my Wavetable synth"

> "Set filter cutoff to 0.3 and resonance to 0.7 on track 2's device"

> "Snapshot the current Operator preset, tweak it brighter, then morph back 50% toward the original"

> "Generate an aggressive reese bass preset for Operator"

> "Create a macro that links filter cutoff, reverb send, and delay feedback to one knob"

### Deep Device Access (Max for Live)

> "Show me what's inside the Drum Rack on track 3 — all chains and nested devices"

> "Get all parameters of the compressor nested inside chain 0 of my Instrument Rack"

> "Read the Simpler sample info — show me warp markers, slices, and playback mode"

> "Set Wavetable's LFO1 modulation to filter cutoff at 0.6"

> "Batch-set 12 hidden parameters on my synth in one shot"

### Mixing & Arrangement

> "Set track 1 volume to -6 dB and pan slightly left"

> "Create a reverb return track and send drums to it at 30%"

> "Create a filter sweep automation from 0.2 to 0.9 over 8 bars on track 2"

> "Mute tracks 3 and 4, solo track 1, and arm track 2 for recording"

> "Insert 4 bars of silence at bar 17 in the arrangement"

> "Get arrangement clips on all tracks and give me an overview of the structure"

### Session Management

> "Give me a full overview of all tracks — names, devices, arm states, volumes"

> "Snapshot every device on tracks 0 through 3 as 'verse preset'"

> "Compare my 'verse' and 'chorus' snapshots and show what changed"

> "Search the browser for 'vocoder' and load it on the master track"

> "List all my snapshots and delete the ones from yesterday's session"

## Architecture

```
Claude AI  <--MCP-->  MCP Server  <--TCP:9877-->  Ableton Remote Script
                          |
                          +---<--UDP/OSC:9878/9879-->  M4L Bridge (optional)
                          |
                          +---<--HTTP:9880-->  Web Status Dashboard
```

- **Remote Script** (TCP) — 128 tools. Runs as a Control Surface inside Ableton. Handles tracks, clips, MIDI, mixing, automation, browser, snapshots, macros, presets.
- **M4L Bridge** (UDP/OSC) — 10 tools. A Max for Live device that accesses hidden parameters, rack chain internals, Simpler sample data, and Wavetable modulation matrices.
- **Web Dashboard** — real-time status, tool call metrics, and server logs at `http://127.0.0.1:9880`.

## Stability & Reliability

AbletonMCP is built to handle real-world sessions without crashing Ableton. Every crash discovered during development was traced to a root cause and fixed with a targeted safeguard:

- **Chunked async LiveAPI operations** — large device discovery (93+ parameters) is split into 4-param chunks with 50ms delays between each. Prevents synchronous LiveAPI overload that crashes Ableton's scripting engine.

- **Chunked response protocol** — large responses (>1.5KB JSON) are split into 2KB pieces, each base64-encoded independently with URL-safe conversion, wrapped in a chunk envelope, and sent via deferred `Task.schedule()`. The Python server detects, buffers, and reassembles automatically. Small responses pass through unchanged (backward compatible).

- **URL-safe base64 encoding** — all M4L bridge data uses `A-Z a-z 0-9 - _` only. Standard base64 `+` and `/` characters conflict with Max's OSC address routing and are never used.

- **Deferred `Task.schedule()` processing** — all M4L outlet calls are deferred to avoid blocking Ableton's main audio/UI thread. No synchronous outlet from discovery callbacks.

- **LiveAPI cursor reuse** — rack chain discovery uses `goto()` to reuse 3 cursor objects instead of creating ~193 new LiveAPI instances per call. Prevents Max `[js]` memory exhaustion on large drum racks.

- **Fire-and-forget parameter writes** — `set()` calls do not read back the value afterward. Post-set `get()` readback was the #1 crash pattern across hidden params, wavetable props, and chain device params.

- **Dynamic timeouts** — M4L command timeouts scale with operation size (~150ms per parameter, minimum 10s). No fixed timeouts that fail on large devices.

- **Socket drain on send** — clears stale UDP responses before each new command to prevent response contamination from prior calls.

- **Singleton guard** — exclusive TCP port lock (9881) prevents duplicate MCP server instances from conflicting.

- **Disk-persisted browser cache** — 6,400+ browser items cached to `~/.ableton-mcp/browser_cache.json`. Loaded instantly on startup (~50ms). Background refresh keeps it current. No 2-3 minute wait on first launch.

- **Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff** — both TCP and UDP connections recover automatically from Ableton restarts or network interruptions.

## Flexibility

- **Works with any MCP client** — Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any tool that speaks the Model Context Protocol
- **128 tools without Max for Live** — the TCP Remote Script covers tracks, clips, MIDI, mixing, automation, browser, snapshots, macros, and presets. M4L is optional.
- **+10 deep-access tools with M4L** — hidden parameters, rack chain internals, Simpler samples, Wavetable modulation
- **Web dashboard** — live monitoring of connection status, tool calls, and server logs at port 9880
- **Ableton Live 10, 11, and 12** — graceful API fallbacks for version-specific features (extended notes, capture MIDI, arrangement placement)
- **Cross-platform** — Windows and macOS
- **Quick setup** — `uv run` for the MCP server, copy one folder for the Remote Script, drop one M4L device for the bridge
